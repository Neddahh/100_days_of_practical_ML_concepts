# 100 Days of Practical ML Concepts

ML is an ever evolving field. With no end to practical ML concepts, there exists a gap between what is actually needed in industry v/s what is taught in the universities. This repo aims to bridge that gap. Clean bite-sized concepts. With lots and lots of reading material. Enjoy :)
Full disclosure: I have used AI (CLAUDE SPECIFICALLY) as a mentor, teacher, my research buddy and coding partner. The lecture notes for each day are hand_written (with little to no AI). The study guides in some cases were partially suggested by the AI as well however. Every material shared has been personally vetted by me for relevance.

## What's Inside

Each day has its own folder structured like this:

```
Day_01/
├── README.md        # Topic overview + reading material links
├── notes/           # Personal notes and summaries
└── code/            # Implementations and experiments
```
